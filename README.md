# foxDot_tunings
A tuning dictionary available to use in FoxDot

More info about tunings and xenharmonic music at [The Xen Wiki](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Main_Page).  

The xen wiki has a powerful research tool that can be used. Exemple for the ET20 scale located in et_tuning.py, just type a research of "20edo".  

EDO means Equal Division of Octive.  
ET means Equal Temperament.  
EDO and ET are interchangeable designations [(article)](https://sevish.com/2016/whats-the-difference-between-et-and-edo/)

JI stands for Just Intonation.  
It designates the fact of messing around the pitch frequency ratios.  

I've used two different classes to build such tunings in FoxDot, because, EDO tunings can be generated only using cents,
while JI tunings involve frequency ratios, that then are converted to cents.
